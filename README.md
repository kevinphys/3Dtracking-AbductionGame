#####UFO WARNING !!!!!

This is a funny game made from two kinds of different project.

Based on Arduino, we finally can destroy all human beings in the world (the "L3D cube" world). HURRAY!!

##Get started
* Make your own [3D-tracking system](http://makezine.com/projects/a-touchless-3d-tracking-interface/) by [Steve Hobley](http://www.stephenhobley.com/blog/)
* [L3D cube](http://www.l3dcube.com) by [Shawn Frayne](http://solidcon.com/solid2014/public/schedule/speaker/169607) and his team
* [Processing](https://processing.org)

###Uploading code to Arduino
By __"_3DInterface.ino"__, Arduino can receive the data from three capacitances. See more [3D-tracking system](http://makezine.com/projects/a-touchless-3d-tracking-interface/) details here.

###Using with Processing
My roommate [peter26194](https://github.com/peter26194) and I wrote the original game (in __Abduction3D__ folder) first. You can try to play on your computer without L3D cube and feel how amazing is 3D-tracking system with only three capacitances.

Later, if you get one L3D cube, then in __Abduction3D_with_L3D__ folder, you would see the best 3D display game ever. We use the [streaming code](https://github.com/enjrolas/L3D-Software) here. It's like old school low pixel games before. That's AWESOME!!

##WARNING AGAIN!

##Big thanks to
* [peter26194](https://github.com/peter26194) for being my roommate and writting code togeter
* [Taipei Hackerspace](https://taipeihack.org/) what a wonderful place
* [Shawn Frayne](http://solidcon.com/solid2014/public/schedule/speaker/169607) for donating one of their rare version L3D cube to Taipei Hackerspace
* [Steve Hobley](http://www.stephenhobley.com/blog/) for his simple and briliant 3D tracking code by Arduino
